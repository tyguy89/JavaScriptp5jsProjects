# CS30 final project Proposal

I want to build a diving game (simulator). It will be a diving game with boards, positions and scoring.

## Need to Have List
- Player sprite
- Gravity of player
- Rotation of player
- Water (ground)
- 2 board heights (3m/5m, 10m)
- Tuck position (increased rotational speed)
- Dive scoring with angle of entry(one score)
- Forward Dives
- Dive logic (tap of the button)
- menu
- Splash sound
- Competition (2)
- Gui

## Nice to Have List
- Making it actually look good
- Multiple players
- Landing angle with sounds
- Dive DD calculations (difficulty of dives)
- All board heights
- Complex scoring (3-7 scores)
- Sounds
- V.S. mode (2 players - turn based)
- Many levels of competitions
- Water splash physics
- Pike position
- Twisters
- Backwards Dives
- Reverse Dives
- Inward Dives
- Handstands
